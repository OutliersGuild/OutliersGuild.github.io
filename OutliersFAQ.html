          <p><h3>Traditionally, we have distributed loot via loot council. In this system, raiders who have high attendance rates, show up on time, and perform optimally receive loot preference over others. In the case that two players need an item and are equal in these categories, we will consider rank as a factor (e.g. trial vs raider vs core).</h3></p>

            <p><h3>Any player we recruit is expected to raid. We do not recruit for a bench, and expect any person recruited to be geared and prepared for current content. That being said, if a fight requires a specific raid comp or class, there is the chance you may sit or be asked to play an alt if it's geared.</h3></p>

            <p><h3>All raiders are expected to make raid with 90% attendance and be online at 7:20pm for raid invites so we can start promptly at 7:30pm. We understand that everyone has lives and you may have to miss here or there, but for the sake of 19 other people's time, we expect raiders to consistently show up to raids. A key part of progression is bringing in the same 20 people each night, and maintaining 90% attendance allows us to do so.</h3></p>

                <p><h3>Whether you are in discord or in guild chat, you can always find a casual and friendly environment. Raiders are often running keys, farming old content, or hanging out in discord. During raid times, we take things a bit more seriously, and try to keep chatter to a minimum. While we value every raiders opinion on strategy and lets people speak their opinion on it, random chatter is better left for after the raid. We only raid 9 hours a week and staying focused and on track is imperative to making sure we clear content in a timely manner.</h3></p>
